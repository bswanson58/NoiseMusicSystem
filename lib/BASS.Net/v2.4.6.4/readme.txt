WARNING
-------
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BASS.NET IS PROVIDED
"AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND/OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE AUTHORS SHALL NOT BE HELD
LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE USE OF BASS.NET. BASICALLY,
YOU USE BASS.NET ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.


SETUP
-----
Run the setup.exe as contained in this zip file and simply follow the instructions.
NOTE:
The Bass.Net.dll release version is now installed in the specified <install-dir> 
and will already be registered to the .NET Framework as a standard component (if you leave the installation options checked).
So when writing your own application using BASS.NET you can simple add a new project reference and select the 
"BASS.NET API" from the standard .NET components tab - that's all.
The native BASS libraries are not included here and need to be downloaded seperately.
In order to run the samples provided, you need to copy the relevant BASS libraries to the output directories first!
To uninstall BASS.NET simple go to the windows control panel and select software...and remove BASS.NET there.


Why a setup and no zip file?
----------------------------
The setup allows automatic integration into your Visual Studio environment (e.g. VS2005).
This is:
- registering the Bass.Net.dll as a .NET Framework assembly component
- integrating the provided BASS.NET MS Help 2.x files into your Visual Studio environment
If you deselect all options during the setup process - then the setup will just extract the files and do nothing more - just like an unzip.


Why 15MB?
---------
The BASS.NET API comes with a total of 3 different help systems, for maximum convenience.
Each help system takes around 8 MB and covers BASS and all Add-Ons. So total of approx. 15 MB help files are provided.
This is:
- Bass.Net.xml - which allows Visual Studio to display IntelliSense information during coding
- Bass.Net.chm - the classic MS Help 1.x offline help file for the BASS.NET API
- Bass.Net.HxS - the modern MS Help 2.x online help files which allows full integration into Visual Studio
The actual Bass.Net.dll (which you will ship along with your application) is only approx. 500 KB of size.


What does the Setup do?
-----------------------
a) Lets you select an installation folder
b) Displays the standard license agreement
c) Lets you select three installation options
d) Simply extracts the BASS.NET API files to the installation folder
e) Optionally: Registers the BASS.NET API as a .NET component
f) Optionally: Integrates the BASS.NET API Help files to your Visual Studio environment
g) Optionally: Adds a menu group to your start menu
h) Allows you to uninstall everything


What are the installation options and what do they do?
------------------------------------------------------
a) Register Bass.Net.dll as a .NET Framework assembly component compiled with the 'For Any CPU' setting.
--
Whenever you want to start writing your own applications using the BASS.NET API 
you need to include a reference to the Bass.Net.dll library of course!
In addtion make sure to place the native bass.dll or any add-on you are using in your executable directory as well!
So in your project explorer you need to select "Add Reference..." and select the Bass.Net.dll
This option will automatically register the BASS.NET API as a .NET component - so it will be listed in the first tab!
Actually the following will be done by the setup...
Create a new registry key "BASS.NET API" under
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\AssemblyFolders"
resp.
"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\AssemblyFolders"
the value will be set to the selected install directory - that's all - and gets the Bass.Net.dll listed as a .NET component.


b) Integrate the BASS.NET API Help files to your Visual Studio environment
--
Do you know how MS Help 2.x works? It is the new Microsoft help system being used in Visual Studio (among others).
During coding you can press F1 while your cursor is over a command, class, keyword etc. and it will bring up the help online.
Or you can open the help manually when selecting "Help" from the main menu of your Visual Studio environment.
The BASS.NET API also comes with Help 2.x files. This options installs and merges these files into the ms-help system, 
so that they are availabe online during coding as well - just like for any other .Net component.
It also adds a filter to the online ms-help system. Just try it out and you will how nice it is to get the help online by pressing F1
over any piece of BASS code.
If you have deselected this option during installation you can simply install and or uninstall this feature manually.
- Open a 'Command Prompt' (cmd.exe) and go to the "<install-dir>\Help" directory
- Call "H2Reg.exe -r -m" to register the help files to your ms-help system manually
- Call "H2Reg.exe -u -m" to unregister the help files from your ms-help system manually
The BASS.NET API Help files will be integrated into the Visual Studio 2003 and/or 2005 namespace.

c) Add a shortcut to the Start > All Programms menu
--
Simply creates a menu group called "BASS.NET API" and adds it to the Program menu of your Start menu.

Third party intellectual property rights
----------------------------------------
BASS.NET is a .Net wrapper of the product BASS (www.un4seen.com). In order to use BASS.NET an additional BASS license needs to be obtained separately.
MP3 technology is patented, and so the use of the BASS MP3 decoder in the PRODUCTS requires the LICENSEE to have a patent license from Thomson (www.mp3licensing.com).
Alternatively, the LICENSEE does not need a patent license if BASS is set to use the already licensed Windows MP3 decoder.
