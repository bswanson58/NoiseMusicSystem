BASS.NET API - Freeware License
-------------------------------

Date: 2010/06/22

This license agreement is a legal agreement between -Bill Swanson, 43W202 Connors Rd, Elgin, IL- (the 'LICENSEE') and -radio42, Gryphiusstrasse 9, 22299 Hamburg, Germany- (the 'LICENSOR'), for use of the BASS.NET API software ('BASS.NET') in any of the LICENSEE’s freeware software ('FREEWARE').

Freeware software is herewith defined as computer software developed for the public domain and for personal use only and for non-money making use, to which no charge is associated at all and which has absolutely no commercial purpose. Freeware software - if made available for use to any 3rd party - must be free of charge, for an unlimited time.

This freeware version of BASS.NET is free for non-money making use. If you are not charging for or making any money with your software AND you are an individual person (not a corporation) AND your software is intended for personal use only, then you can use the BASS.NET API in your software for free.
Free in this case means, that the LICENSEE can use BASS.NET without any further license fees. It does NOT mean that you are free to change, copy, redistribute, share or use BASS.NET in any purpose.

If you wish to use BASS.NET in shareware or commercial software (or your software has any other commercial purpose, e.g. advertising, training etc.), you will require another license which is NOT covered by this license agreement.
This license agreement is ONLY valid for freeware software.

BASS.NET is the property of radio42 and is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties. BASS.NET is not sold, it is licensed. The LICENSOR represents that it has all of the rights necessary to grant to the LICENSEE the rights set forth in this license agreement, subject to the terms set forth below regarding BASS and MP3 technology.

Permitted use and restrictions:
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
This license agreement allows the LICENSEE to use BASS.NET in any of his FREEWARE products.
By using this software, you agree to the following conditions:
 1) The LICENSEE may not charge for or make any money with the software using BASS.NET. The LICENSEE’s software might also have no other commercial purpose and might only be used for personal needs.
 2) It is prohibited to change any of the provided source code and all the files must at any time remain intact and unmodified.
 3) The LICENSEE may not decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or modify any part of BASS.NET.
 4) The LICENSEE may ONLY distribute the DLL part of BASS.NET with the FREEWARE (Bass.Net.dll). No other part of BASS.NET may be distributed.
 5) The LICENSEE may not transfer the license to anyone else.
 6) The LICENSEE may not resell or sublicense BASS.NET.
 7) A splash screen will appear every time at start-up (unless you obtained a valid Registration-Key).

No royalty payments are required for the use of BASS.NET in the FREEWARE, and the LICENSEE may freely use future updates of BASS.NET in updates of the FREEWARE.
This license agreement is between only the LICENSEE and the LICENSOR. The LICENSEE may not transfer the license to anyone else.
The LICENSOR reserves all rights not expressly granted.

Term and termination:
 - - - - - - - - - -
This license agreement will continue in perpetuity unless terminated as set forth herein. This license agreement may be terminated in the event that the LICENSEE breaches any term or condition of the agreement. The LICENSEE may voluntarily terminate this license agreement in writing.
Upon termination of this agreement, the LICENSEE must cease to use BASS.NET in the FREEWARE.

Third party intellectual property rights:
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
BASS.NET is a .Net wrapper of the product BASS (www.un4seen.com). In order to use BASS.NET an additional BASS license needs to be obtained separately.
MP3 technology is patented, and so the use of the BASS MP3 decoder in the PRODUCTS requires the LICENSEE to have a patent license from Thomson (www.mp3licensing.com). Alternatively, the LICENSEE does not need a patent license if BASS is set to use the already licensed Windows MP3 decoder.

Shareware or Commercial Versions:
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
If you are using BASS.NET in software which is NOT FREEWARE (as described above) OR you are trying to make money with your software OR your software using BASS.NET has any commercial purpose OR you are a corporation or company then you must obtain a separate license from radio42!
In this case please obtain a valid license at: www.bass.radio42.com
