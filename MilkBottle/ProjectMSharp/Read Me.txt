To build the ProjectMSharp project:

Create a local copy of the projectM source tree located at: https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm

Either copy or use symlinks to place the wrapper files into place within the projectM source tree:

in projectM/msvc:
	ProjectMSharp.sln
	ProjectMSharp.vcxproj

in projectM/src:
	the ProjectMSharp directory and it's contents.

after building, the resulting ProjectMSharp.dll will be located under: projectM/msvc/ProjectMSharp


to use symlinks:

at a command prompt within the projectM source tree locations discussed above, these commands would be typical:
mklink ProjectMSharp.sln ..\..\Noise\MilkBottle\ProjectMSharp\ProjectMSharp.sln
mklink ProjectMSharp.vcxproj ..\..\Noise\MilkBottle\ProjectMSharp\ProjectMSharp.vcxproj
mklink /D ProjectMSharp ..\..\Noise\MilkBottle\ProjectMSharp\ProjectMSharp
